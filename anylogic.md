A framework to measure every unit of car sold or gas refined on a daily basis, update a distributed ledger and open bids for plantation of trees.

The **[Anylogic ReTree Forest Modeling and Simulation]** is a supporting tool for the Climate Change Initiative, an evidence-based, private led and smart city initiative to accelerate the GHG Removal, using the most sophisticated tools available, including advanced geo-spatial modeling and analytics to measure the largest emissions and develop governance policy using distributed ledger technology and IoT devices, which constitute afforestation with each car sale and gallon refined.

The ABM brings together over 20 technical units from multiple domains across Climate Change, from Forest Cover to Trade and Markets, integrating data from across Industry on Transport, Oil, Manufacturing, Smart City, Forestry, Trade, Social and Economics, among others.

The statistical innovation uses state of the art technologies to address the challenges posed by the Climate Change in the wider context of urbanization, emission, natural disasters and deforestation that are affecting the traditional land-use-planning based GHG Removal. The modeling triggers the need for complex analysis on manufacturing and sales, from global down to the granular level. Zisuz Labs LLC is implementing the combined use of IoT and DLT systems, big data, data science and text mining methods for decision making and impact assessment, where automobile and petrochemical sales are converted to smart city afforestation with effective financial mechanisms and policies.
