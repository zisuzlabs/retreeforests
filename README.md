Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and it's clear that we need to take drastic action if we hope to mitigate its effects. One potential solution that has been gaining traction in recent years is the use of blockchain technology to promote sustainability and reduce our carbon footprint. This is where Green Blockchain comes in. 

Green Blockchain, also known as "ReTree Forests," is a revolutionary new system that uses the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) to promote sustainability and combat climate change. 

The beauty of Green Blockchain is that it is a decentralized system, which means that it is not controlled by any one individual or organization. Instead, it is a network of connected devices that work together to promote sustainability. This makes it incredibly efficient and effective, as it allows for real-time tracking and monitoring of progress. 

The system is projected to cost just $10,000, which is a fraction of the cost of traditional reforestation efforts. This makes it an incredibly cost-effective solution for companies and individuals who want to make a difference.

Green Blockchain, also known as "ReTree Forests," is a revolutionary new system that uses the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and distributed ledger technology (DLT) to promote sustainability and combat climate change. 



# Project Overview
Re-Tree Forest with each automobile sale and every gallon of petrochemical refined is a policy guidelines for the Transportation sector. Petrochemical producers/refiners and consumers are also stakeholders in this policy. The idea is to implement a framework to measure every unit of car sold or gas refined on a daily basis, update a distributed ledger and open bids for plantation of trees.

The policy will strictly monitor automobile sales including car, bike, train-wagon,
airplane or industrial machinery being produced by transport, agricultural or industrial
sector. Any sales would trigger Zisuz Labs LLC’s proposed distributed digital
infrastructure to initiate a transaction. The mechanism of implementing such a complex
set of activities is described later.

The consumer side of the policy implementation is modeled upon shared economy, where the grower has an incentive in planting
trees. The consumer can be anyone from private landowners to government
organizations holding land.

Apart from automobile manufacturers, the petrochemical industry as a whole has a
huge profit incentive in supporting our Re-Tree Forest with each automobile sale and
every gallon of petrochemical refined policy.

Every gallon of gas refined including petrol, diesel or natural gas from the oilfield to
refinery supply chain building ingredients for fertilizers or plastics or chemicals they
add certain dollars to coffers of the policy framework guideline. We will workout an
actual formula for investing their share of dollars while producing or adding value or
consuming a gallon of gas in the refinery supply chain.

Their fair share based on calculation arrived on the basis of market prices of oil per
barrel would be accumulated and transferred to the users. The consumer who is buying
a vehicle of any type would require to Purchase, Plant or Offset the specific amount of
trees to themselves or the manufacturers or the bidders like private landowners
competing for particular exchange’s incentive ownership.

The entity can be anyone whether it can be oilfield producing gas or refineries or allied
petrochemical factories or car dealers or private entity intent in planting specific
numbers of trees based on a gallon refined.

Our Policy Framework guidelines stipulates that each party buying or selling the
vehicle has to be signatory in planting specific numbers of trees themselves. They can
undertake this activity at the point of sale or can forward the responsibility either to the
car dealer or separate entity of their choice. If they partake in the responsibility to plant
the trees in their own backyard or any land affiliated with 1T.org in their area, they can
do so. They are mandated to own a specific number of tree plantations owing to purchase of vehicles in their region. 
The number of trees as a liability is equal to the total cost of vehicle even though paid in part.
Private Landowners are those entities that take offer to plant trees in their territory upon
open bid in the 1T.org based distributed system ledger. Territory close to automobile
deals would be a priority but not mandated. Regions in dire need for reforestation may
use the quotation for their perusal provided they are not the same as the origin of
produce in certain cases.

The inheritor can be anyone; either a car owner planting in his house or it can be
private land owned by an entrepreneur affiliated with the ReTree Forest system. It can
be government owned land outsourcing private tree growers or car dealer's allied
partner bidding transactional implementation privately or through a system.

# Distributed systems & ledger
The policy mandated sales and commissioning of reforesting trees with the help of
partner entities in transport, private and petrochemical sectors including public
organizations enforcing law and land usage will be under ReTree Forest distributed
digital system.

The distributed digital system is global, community driven and open.
Global means the availability and maintainability is at world scale encompassing all
member states under WEF in a single consistent digital interface.

Community driven means the implementation is such that any one from individual to
government entity manufacturing say fighter jets can join the platform and participate. It
has to be 99.99% reliable and accessible —for evil or allied— like the internet.

Open means the distributed system should be free from any firewalls or restrictions on
the basis of politics or money or class. It has to be net neutral. Its interface open and
distributed consistent all across any spectrum whether he/she being a
poor African land tiller or company executives from BP Shell or Mercedes Benz.
Anyone can utilize add or incur based on its skills or bandwidth. Cartel and grouping
will be deemed anti to its open philosophy and members would be advised to
encompass any one in an open, all-inclusive and flat hierarchy basis.
No restrictions should be placed for entities with evil intentions as long as it leaves the
system in robust state.

Special privileges would only be permitted to owners and maintainers and users as
long as they cannot access or pry on private data of any entity stored in the ledger in
any form like database or physical records in paper form.
The public attributes of this policy framework mandated entities using this ReTree
Forest based distributed system be open and accessible to all. This will lead to
accountability, autonomy and adherence.
The policy has a mandate in any fiscal, physical, financial, distributed or technical
aspect in its charter co-authored by WEF.

# Obstacles
The charter of this mandatory policy framework is very simple Re-Tree Forest with
each automobile sale and every gallon of petrochemical refined. An individual in a
college dorm or an entrepreneur or parties with a budget can develop the system from
basic form to full fledged implementation.

The policy mandates member states to include, follow and implement policy framework
guidelines as mandated by the charter.

The system can be designed on paper or digital systems or even complex systems like
quantum computers as long as they adhere to the philosophy of the charter will be
deemed successful. The protocols mandate such a policy framework to be Global,
community-driven and open

The implementation will strictly have to be attributed to Zisuz Labs LLC as creator and
credited prominently at all spheres of implementation, development, marketing or
maintenance with full disclosure.

A transaction triggered from a sale would result in tree(s) to be planted. A tree can be
any species from flora and fauna of the member states if it meets certain criteria like
height, growth and importance to culture and region. Tree can be anything except a
shrub or crop that is cultivated from human occupation for food or consumption. As like
the dollar or a euro this tree deemed valuable worth saving, not to be cut or burned or
sabotaged, that would devalue the tree, effort, policy or system as whole.

# Technical Details
A distributed digital system will monitor each complex transaction as they occur, record
and initiate processes leading up to Re-Tree Forest.

It is also triggered with each gallon of natural petrochemical is extracted, mined or
refined at any stage with an obligation to plant a specific number of trees in lieu of
production or distribution. Similar to any transaction economic or otherwise where
balance is maintained from equal give and take, the parties involved in transport, oil,
land or consumer by any means have to close open bids (plant trees) at each step.

A QR based technology monitor is attached to the sapling It reminds the system if the
end result is met in full compliance to this policy framework or not. It will monitor
initiation, growth or loss of each individual tree till the lifespan of vehicle, oil, owner
lifespan or land lease unto 100 years or beyond.

Internet of Things will measure 100 parameters over the span of sapling to tree in 5G
Network. The design would be Scalable to trillion endpoints. The DLT based ReTree
Forest implementation would have to create a blockchain based NEW INTERNET.
The IOT devices monitoring trees planted will have transmission and receive radio
communications that will inadvertently create an open terrestrial 5G mesh network.
The ReTree Forest DLT System will be Open, Community Driven, Profitable, Billion
Dollar It will have No Fees except mandatory open bids to retree forest at each step in
transport and energy economy.

Exchange Traded Funds would be accumulated based on Trees, 5G, Land privately
and publicly owned under ReTree Forest Policy. The IOT devices will be part of such
lands.

Entrepreneurs would be asked to manufacture IOT devices locally and would be
compensated by ReTree Forest bids and open quotes. When a certain number of trees
is due after a trigger in Transaction the devices that will monitor implementation and
plantation has to be sourced. A local economy would be generated that can
manufacture on the design (5G Mesh) allocated to local entrepreneurs to manufacture
for their specific region.

Initially those funds would appear from Petrochemical Industry sponsorship at the
beginning of seeding ReTree Forest DLT.

Later the funds will be generated from revenues of successful ICO at a RTF
sponsored global event or ReTree Forest DLT system managed implementation region
geographically.

Proceeds from Such a Sale would be donated in part or full to Isha Foundation for many volunteering activities or expansion it undertakes.

# Industry and Market Risks
REDD+ and several hedge fund managers would compete with ReTree Forest
System. If RTF can manage competition or potential sales from our
technology stack after development and rollout is foreseen.

Failure to implement a system at dealers or land owners bidding for trees at the
inception would need a serious marketing budget. RTF would mitigate
those risks with industry partnerships or government credits from state sponsored
environment regulations.

We are offering a DLT-IOT based design which is Zero Fees based and profitable. Marketing
would be difficult at initial stages but Open Source and Interoperability salient features
would help during initial rollout phases.

# Hardware
A QR based technology monitor is attached to the sapling It reminds the system if the
end result is met in full compliance to this policy framework or not. It will monitor
initiation, growth or loss of each individual tree till the lifespan of vehicle, oil, owner
lifespan or land lease unto 100 years or beyond.

Internet of Things will measure 100 parameters over the span of sapling to tree in 5G
Network. The design would be Scalable to trillion endpoints. The DLT based ReTree
Forest implementation would have to create a blockchain based NEW INTERNET.
System on Chip measuring and monitoring tree growth from sapling to tree with 100
parameters over a lifespan of 100 years.

Battery modules based on solar and cheap hardware requirements are envisioned in
ReTree Forest implementation. Again utility patents can be licensed and the
manufacturing process can be sold for generating revenue during rollout.
The IOT devices monitoring trees planted will have transmission and receive radio
communications that will inadvertently create an open terrestrial 5G mesh network.
Entrepreneurs would be asked to manufacture IOT devices locally and would be
compensated by ReTree Forest bids and open quotes.

As mentioned in the patent readily available IoT devices has been designed on FreeRTOS Architecture 
readily available to all electric engineers. With OpenAI API our inhouse indesigned SOC are scalable 
with 100 analog and digital parameters like humidity temperature, communication, 5G, on device blockchain processing.

AARCH64 or CUDA or x86_64 chips can be costly but upcoming RISC-V Silicon Fab can help in this regard. We can opensource our SOC design and business use case (Green Blockchain) to
meet Raspberry Computers success and emulate low cost computing demand from our entrepreneurs and service providers.
Anil Vendanta Semiconductors are setup with a goal on Defence Contract manufacturing but hey a little hedging can
spruce their extra "mid-afternoon/lazy" income from niche consumer driven demand.
