According to National Cancer Institute website

Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.

Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:

- of errors that occur as cells divide. 
- of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet rays from the sun. 
- they were inherited from our parents. 

The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn cancerous. But the body’s ability to do so goes down as we age. This is part of the reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life.

There were 463,675 new cancer cases estimated to be in Arab countries, corresponding to 2.4% of the global incidence. 
Females' cancers accounted for 52.9% of that number, compared with 47.8% worldwide. 
The ASIR for Arab females was 137.7/100,000, compared with the 186/100,000 population rate of WFCs.

According to research published by NCI nearly 750,000 cases of cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2020, or 4%, can be attributed to 
alcohol consumption, according to a new study. While heavy drinking accounted for most cases, light and moderate drinking accounted for a modest amount.

Arab countries men and women tend not to drink alcohol. More so there are quite a few women who actually smoke generally speaking. 
Religious beliefs in Muslim society bars men and women alike from drinking. Strict rules in Arab countries does not allow freedom among women to 
binge or smoke even. Abstaining from alcoholic beverages or smoking is not even a short time in history phenomenon. 
It's been quite a long since Christ's birth and Islam was practised in Arab countries.

So we can simply rule out genetics factor due to alcohol consumption among men and women in Arab Countries. Alcohol consumption being only 4%; 
it is also insignificant from a mere 2.4% of global incidence.

Smoking remains in the picture with quite a few may almost all men if prone to smoking in Arab countries would not account for 
skewed incidence ratio for women in Arab countries i.e. 52.9% of 2.4% global population suffering from Cancer.

One of the most potent factor suggested by NCI is UV rays from Sun. Regions such as North Africa countries in Middle East Asia 
receives abundant UV rays in the form of sunlight and shallow to almost nil tree cover.

Corresponding to 2.4% of the global incidence. Females' cancers in Arab countries accounted for 52.9% of that number, compared with 47.8% worldwide. 
Hope the Sharia laws from Afghanistan to Iran to Somalia was made by Islam Clerics in the form of Hijab to protect their women from Cancer. 
Funny but it is a wrong assumption in my part to assume Clerics among Arab countries knew cancer before scientists in Europe who diagnosed cancer. 
Partly because Hizab came before advent of a disease called cancer and significantly as a means to prevent male gaze.

#### Caution to users not to lose actual insight or dedcution in this paper

Deduction above implies based on scientific research and empirical data UV rays 
from Sunlight may be the probable cause of cancer among women in Arab 
countries. Data shows incidence ratio is skewed towards them at 52.9%. Might be moral policing 
in Iran's job and Islam Clerics in Iran enforcing strict hizab 
or burqa laws is somehow to save them from cancer which is mere 463,675 new 
cases or just 2.4% of global incidence. But as they say Cancer is cancer and 
it will grow with Global Warming and changing lifestyles with the damage to DNA 
caused by harmful substances in the environment.

Smoking aside according to NCI Sun is to blame for Cancer in Arab countries at last. Ultraviolet rays from Sunlight can change DNA and can cause cancer. 
Though as NCI has said it should be true but can they explain how Africa has lowest incidence report of Cancer patients in the world. 
**Someone has to look at the origin of the disease called cancer which represents the deadliest form of disease affecting 50 million worldwide without 
jumping on to begin curing or finding a cure. May be it will lead to the cure as COVID-19 scientists advent-ed track, trace or secure.**
